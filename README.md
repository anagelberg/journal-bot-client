## :sparkles: Inspiration
With rising mental health issues globally, there's an urgent need for accessible interventions. In Canada alone, over 1.6 million youths face mental health challenges, with significant barriers to accessing timely care. Journaling offers a proven avenue for emotional relief, yet many find it difficult to start or maintain. Our project aims to lower these barriers, offering a supportive tool for those in need.

## :dart: Our Goal
Our mission aligns with the cmd-f hackathon's inclusive healthcare track, aiming to make emotional well-being support more accessible and inclusive.

## :bulb: Our Solution
Journal Bot is an AI-powered platform that provides a confidential and interactive space for users to engage in conversational journaling. By leveraging advanced AI, the platform is designed to be culturally aware and accessible to everyone, supporting a broad spectrum of emotional expressions.

## :earth_africa: Societal Impact
- **Bias Mitigation:** Journal Bot uses a diverse dataset to ensure an inclusive and bias-free environment, accommodating a wide range of emotional expressions and communication styles.
- **Community and Belonging:** The platform encourages open dialogue about mental health, fostering a sense of community and belonging.
- **Accessibility and Confidentiality:** As a free, web-based service, Journal Bot addresses common barriers to mental health care, such as cost, stigma, and geographic limitations.
- **Self-Awareness:** The tool empowers users to better understand their emotions and patterns, promoting proactive mental health management.

## :computer: Technology Stack
Our solution is built on Cohere's powerful AI API, supplemented by a diverse dataset for sentiment analysis. The user interface is developed using React, ensuring an accessible and engaging user experience.
